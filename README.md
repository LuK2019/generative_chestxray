# Latent Diffusion Models for Chest X-Ray Generation using MONAI Generative Models

We use https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/blob/main/mimic-iv-cxr/txt/create_section_files.py to create the text
sections files.

TODO LIST:

- [ ] Add original implementation from adversarial training.
- [ ] Add script to preprocess text data, it should clean and split into sentences.
- [ ] Test with Microsoft and Stable Diffusion text part.
